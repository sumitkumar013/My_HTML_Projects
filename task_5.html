<h2 id="HISTORY">HISTORY</h1>
<p>Vaishali, an ancient city located in present-day Bihar, India, holds significant historical and religious importance. It was the capital of the Vajjian Confederacy, one of the earliest republican systems in ancient India, flourishing around the 6th century BCE. Unlike the monarchies that dominated most of India, the Vajjian Confederacy was governed by elected representatives, making it a unique political entity during that period.

Vaishali is also renowned for its religious significance. It is the birthplace of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, and a key site for Buddhism. The city was visited by Gautama Buddha, who delivered important sermons there. It was also the location of the Second Buddhist Council in 383 BCE, where major decisions regarding Buddhist teachings were made.

Despite its prominence, Vaishali's political and cultural influence waned after the rise of Magadha under King Ajatashatru, who defeated the Vajjian Confederacy in the 5th century BCE. The city eventually declined but remains an important archaeological and religious site, reflecting the rich heritage of ancient Indiaâ€™s republican ideals and its contributions to Jainism and Buddhism. Today, Vaishali attracts pilgrims and historians alike, drawn by its enduring legacy.
