    <h2>Ancient City of Vaishali</h2>
    <p>Vaishali, located in Bihar, India, is one of the world's earliest known republics and holds immense historical and religious significance. It was the capital of the Licchavi republic around the 6th century BCE and is often regarded as the first example of a democratic republic in recorded history.</p>

    <h2>Significance in Buddhism</h2>
    <p>Vaishali is closely associated with the life of Gautama Buddha. It was here that Buddha gave his last sermon and announced his impending Mahaparinirvana (death). The Second Buddhist Council was also held here around 383 BCE, approximately 100 years after the Buddha's death.</p>

    <h2>Significance in Jainism</h2>
    <p>Vaishali is equally important in Jainism. It is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, in 599 BCE. The region played a major role in the spread of Jain philosophy.</p>

    <h2>Archaeological Heritage</h2>
    <p>Today, Vaishali is home to several important historical sites, including the Ashokan Pillar, ancient stupas, and ruins of monasteries. These reflect its past grandeur and cultural richness.</p>
